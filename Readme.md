## Introduction

Databases are the backbone of almost every application, enabling the storage, retrieval, and management of data. This repository covers the foundational concepts of databases, focusing on both theory and practical SQL usage.

## Data Models

### Relational Data Model

The **Relational Data Model** represents data as a collection of tables (relations). Each table consists of rows and columns, where rows represent records and columns represent attributes. SQL is the standard language used to interact with relational databases.

### Entity-Relationship Model

The **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model** is a conceptual representation of the data structure. It uses entities (objects) and relationships to model data. ER diagrams are often used in the initial database design phase.

### Normalization

**Normalization** is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. This involves dividing large tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them.

## SQL Basics

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands are used to define and manage database schema:

- **CREATE TABLE**: Define a new table.
- **ALTER TABLE**: Modify an existing table.
- **DROP TABLE**: Delete a table.
- **TRUNCATE TABLE**: Remove all records from a table.

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to manipulate data within tables:

- **INSERT**: Add new records.
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing records.
- **DELETE**: Remove records.

### Data Query Language (DQL)

DQL commands are used to query and retrieve data:

- **SELECT**: Fetch data from the database.
- **WHERE**: Filter data based on conditions.
- **ORDER BY**: Sort data.
- **GROUP BY**: Group data for aggregation.

### Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL commands are used to control access to data:

- **GRANT**: Provide users with access rights.
- **REVOKE**: Remove users' access rights.

## Advanced SQL

### Joins

**Joins** are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column:

- **INNER JOIN**: Return rows with matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Return all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Return all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN**: Return rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

### Subqueries

A **Subquery** is a query within another query. It can be used to perform complex queries that require data from multiple tables.

### Indexes

**Indexes** improve the speed of data retrieval operations in a database at the cost of slower write operations. They are essential for optimizing large databases.

### Views

**Views** are virtual tables created by querying data from one or more tables. They simplify complex queries and enhance security by restricting access to specific data.

## Database Design

### Normalization

Normalization involves organizing data into tables and establishing relationships between them to minimize redundancy and dependency.

### Keys and Constraints

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies a row in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: Establishes a relationship between two tables.
- **Unique Key**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
- **Check Constraint**: Ensures the validity of the data in a column.
